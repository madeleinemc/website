I'm proud to be part of the team that built the [N26](https://n26.com/en-de/) web app.

##Technical Stack

- React, GraphQL, Express, Redux, ES6
- Fully prerendered using our Express based middleware
- Light & dark mode using css custom properties
- Strong accessibility focus

Alse see my article ["Building the N26 Dark Mode"](https://medium.com/insiden26/building-the-n26-dark-mode-2fc18c2ccdd5) that outlines the engineering and design behind N26's new dark mode.
