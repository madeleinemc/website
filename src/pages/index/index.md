I'm **_Madeleine Chang_**, a **Computer Science** and **Astronomy** double major at Cornell University with algorithms and data analysis experience.

I'm interested in machine learning, graphic design and space exploration! I've worked on projects ranging from galaxy evolution to China's government, and I've used primarily Python for ML and Java/OCaml for SWE. I love exploring the possibilities within computer science, so new projects are always a joy.
