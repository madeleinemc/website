tools: Python, Jupyter Notebook, matplotlib, marvin
date: 2019
intro: 'This galaxy evolution research involved extracting and visualizing spectroscopic maps of galaxies from the MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory) survey using Python. In 2019, I also worked with my research group to categorize over 1000 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and identify post-starburst (E+A) galaxies.'
