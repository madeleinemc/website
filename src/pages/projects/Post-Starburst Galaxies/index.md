title: Post-Starburst Galaxies
tools: Python, Jupyter Notebook, matplotlib, marvin
date: 2017 - 2019
intro: 'I worked in galaxy evolution research with Dr. Charles Liu at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. This involved extracting and visualizing spectroscopic maps of galaxies from the MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory) survey using Python. In 2019, also worked with my research group to categorize over 1000 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and identify post-starburst (E+A) galaxies. These galaxies are particularly interesting because their shape and stellar composition makes up less than 1% of galaxies observed thus far. Our goal is to figure out how, where, and why they occur.'
